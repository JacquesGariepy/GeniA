To invoke the AWS Lambda function 'find-ec2-instances-without-label', we need the following arguments:

1. `lambda_name`: The name of the Lambda function, which is 'find-ec2-instances-without-label'.
2. `region_name`: The AWS region where the Lambda function is deployed, which is 'us-west-2'.
3. `payload`: The payload to be passed as input to the Lambda function. In this case, it should be a JSON object containing the `label_key` and `label_value` parameters.

To execute the Lambda function, AI assistant should follow these steps:

1. Prompt the user to enter the `label_key` and `label_value` values.
2. Construct the payload JSON object with the entered values.
3. Call the `invoke_lambda` function with the `lambda_name`, `region_name`, and constructed `payload`.
4. Handle the response from the `invoke_lambda` function and display the result to the user.

By following this plan, we can invoke the 'find-ec2-instances-without-label' Lambda function with the required arguments and obtain the instances without the specified label.
